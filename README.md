# Vertograd Decorative Typeface

Vertograd is a typeface used for decorative drop caps (*bukvitsi*) in liturgical books of the Russian Orthodox Church published since the late 19th century.

## History

The font was originally designed by Vlad Dorosh as Vertograd UCS for
the [Irmologion project](http://irmologion.ru/fonts.html#Vertograd).
It was then released under the LaTeX Project Public License
as part of [CSLTeX](https://sites.google.com/site/csltex/).
Next, it was reencoded for Unicode by Aleksandr Andreev and released as Vertograd Unicode, part of the
[Slavonic Computing Initiative](https://sci.ponomar.net/fonts.html), and released under SIL OFL v. 1.1.
Edited by Aleksandr Andreev.

## Building the Fonts

The font source is stored in a FontForge SFD file in the `sources/` directory. All modifications should be made in FontForge, resulting in an updated SFD file. This file is then converted to UFO format by running the convert script. From terminal:

```
cd your/local/project/directory
./convert.sh
```

The font can then be built using fontmake and gftools by running:

```
make build
```

Note that this requires Python and will install all of the necessary libraries and tools into a virtualenv at `venv/`.

To delete the virtualenv and the results of the build, run:

```
make clean
```

To build the sample image the sits at the top of this README, run:

```
make images
```

The commands `make update` and `make update-project-template` update the repository structure and Python dependencies and should be run periodically.

Google's master repository also had a GitHub workflow for building the fonts in the cloud on push, but this seems to always fail because of incorrect dependencies, so has been disabled. Instead, built binaries are stored on GitHub in the `fonts/` directory.

## Features

There are no specialized features. Only glyphs used in *bukvitsy* are provided in the font.
